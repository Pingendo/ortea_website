  "body": "Thanks to the technical characteristics of its columnar voltage regulators, ORTEA is able to design and manufacture high power voltage stabilisers (up to 6000kVA at 400V).\r\n\nThe quality and reliability of her equipment has enabled ORTEA to secure numerous orders; in particular, several XXL stabilizers were produced in October: on the right side of the picture we see 3 units of 1250kVA with bypass and automatic circuit breakers, and two of 800kVA for a total power of over 5MVA, ready to be shipped in Africa and North America.\r\n\nEverybody boasts they can do this ... ORTEA really manufactures them!"
