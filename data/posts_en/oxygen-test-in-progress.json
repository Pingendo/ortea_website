  "body": "Three SAG compensators OXYGEN (for a total power of 800kVA), destined to one of the most important European International Airports, are currently being tested in our laboratory. On customerâ€™s request, the cabinets are painted yellow, a color that does not go unnoticed. Once installed, they will provide an important contribution to the Power Quality efficiency of the hub facilities, by counteracting the effects of voltage SAGs."
